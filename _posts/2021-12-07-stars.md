It is a great milestone for our project, now we have 500+ starts on Github and 500+ members in the Slack workspace.

I've been working on this for more than three years and would like to say thank you for all contributors and users who made it possible.

Also, I would like to mention that in terms of stars, recognition, promotion, new features implemented and applications developed on top of BrainFlow this year was incredible for our project. I am looking forward seeing further progress of BrainFlow project and community growing!
